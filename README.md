# man pages

Many bash and cli tools are tricky for newcomers to understand. My hypothesis is that this is because manuals are written in encyclopedic format rather than didactic format. This repo is an attempt to correct this problem for my own edification and education. If others find it useful then that's great. If there's already a project which does this well then that's great please create a github issue linking to that project because I would be interested in that.
